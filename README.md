# Josh's Portfolio

React application to build my portfolio. Most data is loaded from within `/src/data/*.json` files. The app is targeted to be hosted as a static webpage and uses [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)'s HashRouter to best handle the site having routes

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
