    "about": "Hi! My name is Josh and I love coding, music and video games! I've been programming since I started learning in 2015 and have always had a massive interest in playing and creating video games.\\n\\nI will graduate from the University of Wolverhampton in 2021, studying Computer Science specializing in games development. Before University, I found my love for programming at an apprenticeship, where I began by working on projects such as assisting on a Unreal Engine 4 game, to developing a WPF application in C# for 3 years. Since then, I have consistently worked on projects in my own time and continued to develop myself and my skills.\\n\\nI have been learning Chinese since 2016 and can speak to a near proficient level, but can understand and communicate effectively in reading and writing.",
